Hello,
I am Ali Baran Erkmen.
I am 19 years old, a first year management information systems student.
I want to improve myself in the field of cyber security.
I can say that DevSecOps and cloud security are my areas of interest and areas in which I want to improve myself.
There's not much I can talk about myself right now since I'm just starting out, so I'm exploring myself. 
But I am sure that I will be a successful cybersecurity expert when I graduate from university!
